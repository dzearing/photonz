# Tools

All tool math lives in `PhotonzCore` (mostly `Geometry`) and is unit-tested. Views only translate gestures into geometry calls.

## Crop

- Marquee drag → `Geometry.clampCrop` (handles negative-size drags and canvas bounds).
- Whole-document crop: `PhotonzDocument.crop(to:)` rebases layer frames, drops layers left fully outside.
- Per-layer crop: `layer.crop` rect, non-destructive, applied at render time.
- UI: rule-of-thirds grid overlay, edge/corner handles, aspect-ratio locks (1:1, 4:3, 16:9, free), ⏎ commits, ⎋ cancels.

## Resize

- `PhotonzDocument.resize(to:)` scales all layer frames via `Geometry.resizeScale`.
- UI: dialog with pixel/percent units, aspect lock, common presets (50%, @1x from @2x screenshot).

## Skew / transform

- `Geometry.skewTransform(xAngle:yAngle:around:)` — affine skew about the layer center.
- Layer transforms compose: scale (from frame) → skew → translate. Stored on the layer in Phase 3 as a `LayerTransform` struct.

## Annotations (Phase 3)

`AnnotationContent`: arrow, rectangle, highlight, ellipse, line. Stroke width, color, start/end points in layer-local coords.
- Arrows: quadratic-curve option, head scales with stroke width.
- Highlight: multiply-blended translucent fill.
- Rendered by a CoreGraphics rasterizer in `PhotonzRender` (pixel-tested), then composited like any image layer.

## Text (Phase 3)

`TextContent`: string, font name, size, weight, color. Rasterized via CoreText (`TextRasterizer` also measures `naturalSize` and picks the family face nearest a `TextWeight`). Interaction: text tool click places an inline `NSTextView` editor on the canvas (zoom-scaled to match the final render); click-away commits a layer whose frame hugs the measured text, Esc cancels, double-click re-edits in place (the layer hides under the editor). Style popover gains font/size/weight menus for the text tool; current style persists via `TextStyles` in UserDefaults.

## Zoom callout (Phase 5) — signature feature

Select a box → magnified copy placed nearby with leader lines back to the source.
- `Geometry.zoomCalloutPlacement` picks the quadrant with the most free space, clamps on-canvas.
- `Geometry.leaderLines` connects the two nearest corner pairs.
- Rendered as a `ZoomCalloutContent` layer: source region re-rendered at `magnification`, styled with border + shadow + corner radius; source box gets a matching outline.
- Stays live: if the underlying pixels change, the callout re-renders (it references the canvas region, not a baked copy).
